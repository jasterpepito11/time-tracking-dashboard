## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS v4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tanstack React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) For data fetching and handling state management in react
- [Vite](https://vite.dev) - React Dev Tool
- [Bun v1.2](https://bun.sh/docs) - All-in-one toolkit for js/ts apps(drop-in replacement for nodejs)

### What I learned

For this challenge, I was able to continue to integrate new tech stack that will help me with
the current needs, for this specifically I added using Tanstack query for data handling.
I also learned how to properly use grid  and flex CSS properties.


### Continued development

Instead of just fetching data from a local json file, I tried to make it behave like the data
is being fetched from an api server and handle the behavior in the UI when the data is still fetching. I will try to use all the tech stack that I used for this challenge to further improve my knowledge.
